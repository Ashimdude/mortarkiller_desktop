This is the fastest and the most accurate way to aim the mortar in PUBG: Battlegrounds

THIS IS NOT CHEAT. IT DOES NOT HOOK ONTO THE GAME.
This is just a windowsforms app that gets snapshots of mouse positions when you tell it to.
and reads hotkeys using known clean c# methods.

USAGE:
Select your FOV in the app. 103 gives you the most ability, so just use that in-game please.
Use borderless screen mode in-game.

When you want to prime the app, bring it up with ctrl + F and enable it to read the rest of the hotkeys.
This will block these keys system-wide. You can also  stop this by unchecking the box.
but ctrl+F will work always. It brings up the box over pubg automatically.


Press Ctrl + Q somewhere on one side of a 100m square on the map.
Can be done on the minimap as well.
using your desired map zoom.
and press Ctrl + W somewhere on the opposite side of the same square.
Whatever is greater, the difference between X or Y of your mouse positions, the program accepts as 100m on your screen
pretty simple in practice. But try to be accurate with this

You only need to do this once, if you do not plan to use a different map scale when measuring distance.

To measure distance between yourself and the target, you use Ctrl+A for yourself and Ctrl + S for target.
Try to be accurate with this as well
then, you exit map view, unless you used the minimap.
Get on the mortar, aim exactly at the target mark on the compass
(do exactly this, or it wont work)
Press ctrl+F one time to bring up the app over pubg
aim cursor at the mark on your screen this time, without map.
Press ctrl+F ONCE AGAIN.

Now, the app gave you firing solutions, sorted by how close they are.
The pubg mortar has a random spread of 10 meters.
You just need to use the aiming setting highlighted in green and fire as many shots there as possible, some should hit.
Enjoy your accurate mortar shots
